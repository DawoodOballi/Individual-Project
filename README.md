#### Goal: Create a fully functional login window.

#### Review: 

| COMPLETE | INCOMPLETE |
| :------- | ---------- |
| Login    | Logout     |

#### Retrospective:

* **Learned**: Ask for help initially before attempting to solve the problem on my own.
* **Do Differently:** Write out all the user stories first then begin implementing them.
* **Next time:** Make sure if any user stories are finished before the end of the sprint then add another user story to the sprint backlog.
